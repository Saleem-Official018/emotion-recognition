# Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning

A deep learning project using RNN to recognize emotions from user-uploaded images. Detects facial expressions and outputs the identified emotion.

## Features
- Real-time emotion detection from images
- Support for 7 basic emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral)
- User-friendly web interface using Streamlit
- Pre-trained model for accurate predictions
- Visual probability distribution of emotions

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saleem-Official018/emotion-recognition.git
cd emotion-recognition
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started
ðŸ‘‰ To get started:

1. Make sure you have the pre-trained model file (`emotion_rnn_model.h5`) in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to launch the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
3. The app will automatically open in your default web browser

## Usage
1. Upload a grayscale image (48x48 pixels) using the file uploader
2. The app will automatically process the image and show:
   - The uploaded image with the predicted emotion
   - A bar chart showing the probability distribution across all emotions
